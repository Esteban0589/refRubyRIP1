Sweatshirt

Chillin' with a hairtie,
no makeup with some sweatpants on.
You know I can always be that guy,
you can think about me all night long.
But I think you need something to think of me.
Something that will keep you warm
and show you we can be more than just this
So baby if you are not ready for my kiss
Then you can wear my sweatshirt
And you can tell your friends we'll be together till the end
Girl you can wear my sweatshirt
Cuz you're the only one I hold and I don't want you to be cold
So baby wear mine
When you go to sleep at night, When you wake up in the morning
And when you walk the halls girl you know wanna flaunt it
Said this may be the start of something new
Girl I'm gonna tell you exactly what I wanna do is more than just this
So baby if you are not ready for my kiss
Then you can wear my sweatshirt
And you can tell your friends we'll be together till the end
Girl you can wear my sweatshirt
Cuz you're the only one I hold and I don't want you to be cold
So baby wear mine and you can wear my, my, my, my sweatshirt
And I don't want you to be cold, cold, co- co- co- cold
So you can wear my
So you can wear my sweatshirt
And you can tell your friends we'll be together till the end
Girl you can wear my sweatshirt
Cuz you're the only one I hold and I don't want you to be cold
So baby wear my
Sweatshirt
Cuz you're the only one I hold and I don't want you to be cold
So baby wear my

I Want To Be Your Lady Baby

Boy you should know that
I've got you on my mind
Your secret admirer
I've been watching you
chorus (2x)
At night i think of you
I want to be your lady baby
If your game is on give me a call boo
If your love is strong, i gotta give my all to you
Everyday I pray my heart can win
Every night I pray I can call you my man
Yeah yeah yeah
I need you
I want you
To have you, hold you, squeeze you
So I'm going out every weekend
Just to see my boo again
chorus (2x)
These feelings I have for you
Can go deeper if you can come
Correct with your game boy (no, no, no)
No you can't be lame boy
But if you can please me
Then my love will come easy
I'll do anything you want
I'm thinking of you
chorus (2x)
Boy you've got all I need
From what I see
And boy every night i am constantly thinking of you
